title: AppleScripts for iTunes
---
AppleScript is the hidden "glue" language that binds software on the Mac together and allows for unparalleled interaction between apps.  When built into a program, it allows anyone with the right tools to automate nearly any function of the appication.  In fact, it's what Apple's Automator is built upon, making AppleScript more accessible to end users who don't want to know or care about things like variables and loops.  Where Automator is as easy as drag-and-drop, programming AppleScript can be complicated (perhaps more so for seasoned programmers).

Doug Adams, however, is an AppleScript wizard, and his huge library of scripts covers all kinds of Mac applications.  Of particular interest are his [iTunes scripts](http://www.dougscripts.com/itunes/).  He offers dozens upon dozens of cool and useful ready-to-run code samples that do all kinds of tricks with iTunes, including managing playlists, embedding and exporting album artwork, finding and replacing text in track names, and tons more.  For getting more out of your Mac and iTunes, check out Doug's AppleScripts library.
