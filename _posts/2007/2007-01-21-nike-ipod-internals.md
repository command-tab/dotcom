title: Nike+iPod Internals
---
Curious how the Apple/Nike+ iPod accessory set works, the hackers over at [SparkFun](http://www.sparkfun.com) have taken apart both the shoe insert and the iPod receiver.  You can check out all the details [here](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/present.php?p=Nike_iPod-Internals), including some discussion of the hardware choices Apple made.

Interestingly, the shoe insert is transmit-only, whereas the little white gadget that plugs into the iPod's dock connector has a chip capable of both reception _and_ transmission.  With the right hacking, it might be possible to get iPods to talk to each other over a short range -- surely not fast enough to transfer music, but "now playing" info is within the realm of possibility.
