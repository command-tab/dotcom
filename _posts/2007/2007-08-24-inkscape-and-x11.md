title: Inkscape and X11
---
While attempting to install the open source vector graphics program [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org), I found that I needed to install the latest version of X11 (a window system used on Unix systems as well as Mac OS X).  However, I couldn't easily find the installer on Apple's site, but I did discover it buried on my MacBook Pro Install Disc 1 at: `/System/Installation/Packages/X11User.pkg`.  It's also likely available for installation during system setup and while booted off the disc, however no reboot is necessary to install and run X11.
