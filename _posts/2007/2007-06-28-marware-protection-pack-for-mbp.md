title: Marware Protection Pack for MBP
---
Having sold my PowerBook for a little less than I was hoping for, presumably due to the wear on the palm rest, I decided to take some precautions with my new Mac.  Shortly after ordering the machine, I also purchased the Marware Protection Pack for the MacBook Pro.  The one piece of the kit I was most interested in was the palm rest cover, made of a gray, rubbery-leathery material with just the right texture.

Applying the palm rest cover wasn't too hard, but took some nudging to work out a few small air pockets that developed.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with the feel of my new palm rest, and can work without worry that every minute the metal finish may be degrading under my wrists.  Small bubbles aside, the only real drawback was that the display no longer closed easily, despite the advertisement that the cover didn't interfere with the latch mechanism.  I debated removing the palm rest cover altogether, but instead I looked more closely and saw that the small rubber nubs on the lid of the display were keeping the latch at too great a distance from the hook in the base.  After peeling up the corner of the cover, I cut off two iny triangles, as seen at right.  The display now closes as easily as before the cover was applied.

Overall, the kit is a nice improvement with a few little hangups, but it should really pay off in about three or four years when my palm rest is still in great condition!
