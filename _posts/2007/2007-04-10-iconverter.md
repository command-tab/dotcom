[Iconverter](http://www.students.niu.edu/~z110241/index.html) is a simple little utility I discovered which helps you juggle between images, ICNS files, and actual "pasted" icons for Mac files and applications. Often when dealing with icons, I find the need to convert an ICNS file to an editable PNG image with transparency, or go from a PNG back to an ICNS. As much as I like [IconBuilder](http://iconfactory.com/software/iconbuilder/), my needs are not nearly that complex, and Iconverter simply gets the job done. What I enjoy most about the little app is the "Use file contents" checkbox, which will force it to read the data from the file instead of the icon itself -- most other icon utilities default to using the system-designated icon of an opened ICNS file (a file with dog-eared corner), not the actual file contents. Iconverter handles this with ease, and is my first choice for getting icons just right.
