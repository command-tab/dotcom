I just picked up a neat little handheld device on eBay, a [ZipIt wireless messenger](http://zipitwireless.com/productzip.html). Originally intended to be used as a portable, wi-fi enabled chatting device for teens, it can also be reflashed to run a tiny distribution of Linux (actually, it already runs Linux, but the reflashed version is considerably more hacker-friendly). I've only had it for a few hours now, and I've already got Linux flashed, booting, ready, but it looks like it will take extra modification to run something more useful like an SSH client. Telnet works out-of-the-box.

I'm not quite sure what I intend to do with it just yet -- perhaps a portable email client or SSH server-controller is in store. For $25, though, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to hack around with such a cool little device.
