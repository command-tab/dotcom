title: iPod, iPhone, and AppleTV Video Guide
---
[iLounge](http://ilounge.com/) just posted an [outstanding guide](http://ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/the-complete-guide-to-ipod-video-formats-and-display-resolutions/)to the formats used by Apple's video-capable portable devices, including the iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV. While QuickTime Player Pro does a decent job of doing simple exports, it's great to understand the details behind the scenes, including video aspect ratios and bitrates. If you own one or more of these devices and plan on converting video for them, this guide is a must-read!
