title: Seagate Hard Drive RMA
---
In the past, I've had the best luck with Seagate brand hard drives -- avoiding Maxtor like the plague -- but just recently I had a 320 GB Seagate SATA drive start failing on me.  It started with what sounded like a few small read/write head hiccups, and turned into widespread sector failure, causing several diagnostic utilities to red flag the drive.

I bought the drive from NewEgg, but they referred me to Seagate for support and returns.  With no other alternatives available and a failing drive on my hands, I got in touch with Seagate and filled out their online return merchandise form.  Just a few days after shipping off the dying drive, I received an email letting me know that a brand new drive was on its way to me.  I'm happy to be kept in the loop while the return is in progress, and I'll update this post when I get the new drive!

While I had to cover the nominal shipping costs myself, I feel compelled to note how easy and fast their service is.  I'm attempting to make a habit of documenting _good_ customer service as well as the bad.  After having dealt with some online returns that are a real hassle, Seagate is a refreshing change from some of the other rather lame options out there.

**Update:** Received an entirely different "Certified Repaired" hard drive in a very well packed box!  It works great and passes all my tests!
