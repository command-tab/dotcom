For the graphic designers and Photoshop enthusiasts, here are a few resources for identifying fonts: 

[WhatTheFont](http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) is far and away my favorite tool in the bunch primarilty because it's automated, fast, and shockingly accurate. Just upload an image (the more contrast, the better) or provide a URL and their software will match characters and, more often than not, the correct font name.

If fully automated solutions are of no help, you can always call upon others in the industry who deal with typefaces every day. Someone out there knows about your font, and the [WhatTheFont Forum](http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/) is one of the best places to get a good response.

[Identifont](http://www.identifont.com/) helps you find fonts by asking multiple questions about the font you're looking for. It's a unique approach that, in my usage, works about 30 to 40 percent of the time. As a last resort, it may very well come through, despite it's apparently limited font selected.
