I'm sure you've all read the big news from Apple today: everything is smaller, and with video.  Oh, and a touch-capable iPod, with WiFi and mobile iTunes Music Store.  As far as I'm concerned (in my spacious AT&T-free Mountain Time zone) Apple took the best parts of the iPhone and the iPod, and made an ultra-slick little device that's a mere 8mm thin.  I couldn't be more excited about it, not just because of the killer features and gorgeous interface, but for the true mobile web.

I've never owned a portable device that was capable of browsing the web, and I think Apple's implementation is just spot-on.  I can't wait to develop for both the standard web browsers plus the iPod touch.  Many have already jumped on board with the mobile web as presented by the iPhone, and I hope to add my skills to the fray, including CSS and JavaScript.  I've been using both technologies full time for the last 6 months now, and am excited by the "limitation" of a small screen.  Using a smaller space will undoubtedly lead to some simple interfaces and creative solutions for the pocket web world.
