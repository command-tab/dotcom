title: IceKey in Black
---
My favorite keyboard, the [IceKey](http://macally.com/spec/usb/input_device/icekey.html) by MacAlly, is now available in black to match Apple's product lineup.  Though I already have one IceKey, I might just have to order the black version for my PC, as well!  You can never have too many low-profile, laptop style keyboards around.  I couldn't recommend this keyboard any higher, particularly if you enjoy typing with the tactile feedback of Apple laptop keys.
