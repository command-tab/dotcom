title: iPod Hard Drive Technology
---
Tom's Hardware has an excellent article on the [technology of 1.8" iPod hard drives](http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/05/22/1-8_hard_drives_hit_100_gb/index.html) and their increasing capacity. Hard drives are now being produced in 100 GB sizes, which may very well find themselves in new iPods in the near future (although not _too_ soon, as to steal thunder from the iPhone...). Other details noted include transfer rates, access times, and power consumption -- all the gritty specs you'd need for building a low-power 1.8" hard drive based device.

One very surprising fact I learned is that the tiny ZIF connectors on these new drives are rated for a mere 20 insertion (plug/unplug) cycles, which isn't very many if you plan on moving the hardware around a lot. If you own a 1.8"-to-larger IDE adapter, you may want to consider leaving the ribbon cable connected to the adapter at all times. The article is quite a few pages long, but well worth a read.
