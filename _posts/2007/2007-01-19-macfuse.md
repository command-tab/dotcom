title: MacFUSE

Amit Singh, author of the excellent book [Mac OS X Internals](http://www.osxbook.com), has published a Mac version of FUSE, a kernel extension that allows various data structures to be "remapped" as a local file system.  Even internet-dependent sources like Flickr photo albums, RSS feeds, and remotely-connected SSH sessions can be represented as files in a folder.  If you've never seen technology like this before, [this video demo](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3138515991250095768) shows just how cool this stuff is.  There's already a FlickrFS extension that can be implemented with FUSE, so it shouldn't be too much trouble to implement it on the Mac, making Flickr photo managing as easy as drag-and-drop.  After backing up my current system (this is unsupported software), I'll try installing MacFUSE and a handful of plugins.
