title: iPhone NDA Dropped
---
After hearing the cries of thousands of upset iPhone app developers, Apple has [lifted the non-disclosure agreement](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/) covering (released) iPhone software. Developers can now freely talk about the inner workings of their applications, [write](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/amiphd/iphone-sdk-development) [books](http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Developers-Cookbook-Building-Applications/dp/0321555457/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222881181&sr=8-1), publish blog entries, etc. Communicating developers means solutions to common problems get solved and [shared](http://furbo.org/2008/10/01/redacted/), resulting in better software, making the iPhone and iPod Touch platform better as a whole.

For some time I've been worried that the NDA was going to remain in place indefinitely, silencing those who Apple needs the most, but it appears Apple has finally taken a positive action to help their App Store environment grow further. If you thought there was some cool stuff on the App Store now, just give it time.
