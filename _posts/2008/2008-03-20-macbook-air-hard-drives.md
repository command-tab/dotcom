title: MacBook Air Hard Drives
---
Looking through Apple's technical documentation on the MacBook Air revealed that the 80 GB drive it ships with is a Samsung HS082HB 1.8" (4200 RPM, 8 MB cache) ZIF model, a departure from the Toshiba-dominated iPods.  With the same size of only 5mm thin, I wouldn't be surprised if these started showing up in iPod Classic 80 GB models -- it seems likely, given that the low end Classic is the thinner of the two and exactly 80 GB in capacity.  It seems many drive manufacturers are jumping on the 1.8" form factor bandwagon now, which will inevitably result in cheaper pocket-sized storage.
