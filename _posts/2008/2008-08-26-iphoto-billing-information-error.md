title: iPhoto Billing Information Error
---
While trying to order some prints from Kodak/Apple via iPhoto yesterday, I repeatedly got the error message "Please review your billing information and approve it." After checking out my billing information twice, and still getting that error, I found the answer on an [Apple Discussions](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1235552&amp;tstart=2265) thread: Make sure your credit card verification code is entered in the Account Information screen. Why iPhoto doesn't highlight or complain about the missing required field is beyond me, but overlooking this tiny field causes problems that hardly indicate their source.
