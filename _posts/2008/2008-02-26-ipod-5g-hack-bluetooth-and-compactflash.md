title: 'iPod 5G Hack: Bluetooth and CompactFlash'
---
Some clever modders at [iPodHackers](http://www.ipodhackers.net/2008/02/finished-bluetooth-5g-ipod.html) have put together a collection of iPod hacks all inside a single 5th generation iPod: Bluetooth audio streaming, CompactFlash solid-state storage, and a translucent replacement enclosure.

Using a tiny Bluetooth circuit to transmit audio to nearby speakers or headphones and a recently released iPod 5G CompactFlash adapter, the hacked-up iPod can now safely store movies and music without fear of the hard drive failing while stashed safely in a pocket. Of particular note is the custom run adapter, which is the first readily available adapter of its kind that allows storage devices other than hard drives to be attached to the ever-shrinking connectors inside the iPod. You can get the full details and photos [here](http://www.tarkan.info/20080115/tutorials/iflash-ipod-compact-flash-mk2/), and see more hacks at [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/tag/?q=fstedie).
