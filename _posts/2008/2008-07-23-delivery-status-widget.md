title: Delivery Status Widget
---
I don't use the Dashboard in Mac OS X as much as I expected to when it was first released, but when I do, one of the few widgets I employ is [Delivery Status](http://junecloud.com/software/mac/delivery-status.html), which keeps track of packages during shipment. Big, bold numbers display the days until delivery, and smaller text reports on various stops throughout the package's voyage. With support for over 30 carriers, including all of the most common here in the U.S., Delivery Status conveys what you need to know at a glance, making it an ideal Dashboard widget. Also in the works is an iPhone/iPod Touch application serving the same purpose with an interface optimized for touchscreen devices.
