title: Learning Cocoa for the iPhone
---
These last few weeks, I've been teaching myself Cocoa to learn what makes Mac OS X and iPhone OS apps tick. While Objective-C is quite a departure from my usual web development world, it has quickly become one of my favorite languages, as it takes care of much of the drudgery of pure C and has plenty of useful frameworks to get your application up and running quickly. Here are some of the best resources I've found so far:

* [Cocoa Dev Central](http://cocoadevcentral.com/) and [Become an Xcoder](http://www.cocoalab.com/?q=becomeanxcoder) are both excellent tutorials for beginners, written in a clear, straightforward manner. They also explain the ins and outs of memory management, which is critical on platforms like the iPhone and iPod touch.
* Stanford's [CS193P lecture notes](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/) and examples have proven to be one of the best resources for learning Cocoa, particularly for the iPhone. These notes and tests offer Cocoa Touch in bite-size chunks, with a little bit of "on your own" work to ensure you know your stuff before moving on.
* [Google Code Search](https://developers.google.com/code-search) is a good last resort for examples of how others are using a small bit of code or a particular class. For more accurate results, append "lang:objectivec" to your search string to narrow results to only Objective-C code.
