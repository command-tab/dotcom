title: Xbox Media Center 2.0
---
After a long bug-bash, [Xbox Media Center 2.0](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/) is out, and I've been testing it over the last few days. All its features are working and polished just right: video streams perfectly, even over wireless; DVD menus are enabled; [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) submission support is built-in; Project Mayhem III and MediaCenter360 skins are installed by default; and much more! To learn how to set up XBMC 2.0, check out the [online manual wiki](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Xbox_Media_Center_Online_Manual) or stay tuned for Part 3 of [Mac meet Xbox](/2006/08/18/mac-meet-xbox-part-1/) right here at Command-Tab.
