title: Still Hungry, Still Foolish
---
[Jon](http://www.jonsthoughtsoneverything.com) pointed this item out to me. It's a bit dated, but still worth a look. In June of last year, Steve Jobs gave a speech at Stanford, of which I [linked](http://www.command-tab.com/index.php/stay-hungry-stay-foolish/) to audio version. Recently, on [Stanford's podcast](http://www.stanford.edu/), they published the [video](https://deimos.apple.com/WebObjects/ITCSBrowse.woa/wa/Browse/StanfordPublic-1770144-1770146--1770159--13566653_26022267?i=1106939093) of the speech. Like the audio-only version, it's worth saving for a day where you find yourself lacking inspiration and enthusiasm for whatever it is you do.
