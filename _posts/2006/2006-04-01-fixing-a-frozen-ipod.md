title: Fixing a Frozen iPod
---
I've seen a number of questions on the web related to frozen iPods which either get stuck on or off.  Holding the Hard Reset buttons indicated in the previous post will -- if the iPod is accepting any input at all -- force it to do a full reboot.  In most cases, the freeze is a one-time issue, and this solution will get you out of the situation.

However, if the iPod reboots and gets stuck again, try resetting it yet again and holding the Disk Mode buttons to force the iPod to become a simple external hard drive.  When connected via USB or FireWire, it can be Restored with Apple's latest [iPod Updater](http://www.apple.com/ipod/download/) software.  Sometimes a Restore is the best way to get your iPod working again, as it wipes the device clean and reloads all the factory settings.  The Restore function is so deep that it will even fix an iPod hard drive which has been completely written over with zeroes!

If the iPod is still locking up, it may be the result of a more serious problem that can be determined by thoroughly testing the hard drive.  Stay tuned for more iPod fixing tips in the very near future.
