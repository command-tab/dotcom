title: Xbox USB Peripheral Adapter
---
While I'm on the topic of adapters, here's one I just made that allows Xbox peripherals to be connected to a computer.

Right now, the two main items are memory cards and the Xbox Communicator headset, both of which have drivers for Windows available. Hopefully, some kind soul will put together a Mac driver for the headset, as I'd like to be able to use it with Skype (otherwise, yet another adapter is in order to make use of the standard audio plug alone).
