title: Dual Booting on Intel Macs
---
For those who own a shiny new Intel Mac and a copy of Windows XP, it's [now possible](http://nirlog.com/2006/03/18/winxp-and-osx-dual-boot-in-macbook-pro/) to install Mac OS X and Windows on different partitions and pick a system at startup.  Driver support is, not surprisingly, still lacking, but should be brought up to par in the next few weeks.  Apple's transition to the Intel architecture has opened the door both ways -- Windows can run on Macs, and Mac OS X can run on PCs.  Choice is good.
