title: XBMC Changes
---
When updating my copy of Xbox Media Center earlier today, I noticed that the `XboxMediaCenter.xml` file was missing.  Looking into the matter further, I found that some significant changes had been made to the development of XBMC earlier this month.

The original XML configuration file has been removed, and most of the important options have been added to the program settings, allowing new shares to be connected directly inside Xbox Media Center.  Bookmarks can now be added by starting up XBMC, pressing the white button on the controller, and choosing "Add Source."  For those who still prefer to open a file and type in the paths manually, edit the `UserData/sources.xml` [just as you did before](/2005/03/27/sharing-media-to-xbmc/).
