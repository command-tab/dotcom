title: Portable Xbox
---
A creative hacker at [portablesystems.net](http://www.portablesystems.net/xbox%20page1.htm) managed to carefully pack the contents of an Xbox console into a portable form factor.  It's yet another project that makes me exclaim "I had that idea!"  However, the creator did a far better job than I could do with the tools at my disposal.  His hack includes creating a custom vacuum-formed case, hooking up Li-Ion batteries to power the system, and wiring a PSOne LCD to the video output.  It's a masterfully executed hack that sets the standard for his other portable video game creations, and is a must-see for any Xbox hardware hacker.
