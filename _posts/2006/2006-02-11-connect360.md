Connecting a Mac to an original Xbox is a great feature for users of Xbox Media Center, as there are a number of ways to stream your content to your TV. Network shares, iTunes [DAAP](http://daap.sourceforge.net/) access, and several streaming programs can all be used to get your stuff from "here" to "there."

With the release of the Xbox 360, though, there are no easy ways to achieve the same results. The 360 is limited to communication with a Windows Media Center powered PC -- software I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. Luckily, [NullRiver Software](http://www.nullriver.com/) just released [Connect360](http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/connect360), a small $10 shareware Mac application which can eaily share iTunes and iPhoto libraries to your networked Xbox 360. This should tide us over until the 360 is truly as hackable as the original Xbox is. Thanks to [Olly](http://www.nekofever.com/archives/2006/02/connect360/) for the tip!
