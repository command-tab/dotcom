title: iPod Shuffle Shuffle
---
Less than a week ago, my iPod Shuffle gave up on me and refused to play any music.  Pressing buttons resulted in flashing orange-and-green lights, and plugging it into various computers had no effect.  I started thinking that maybe the refurbished 1 GB Shuffle wasn't such a good deal after all.

At a loss, I went to Apple's iPod Support page and requested some help.  I submitted my issue in the hopes that they could either fix or replace my iPod.  Two days later, a brand new iPod Shuffle arrives at my door, courtesy Apple and DHL.  All I had to do was post back my non-functioning unit.  I packaged it up, included the requested cap (what they do with them, I don't know), and sent my dead Shuffle back.  Earlier today, I received an email from Apple Support stating that my shipment arrived and that they hope I'll be happy with my new iPod Shuffle.  Indeed I am.  Never have I had such a great customer service experience with any company.  This, among other reasons, is why I don't mind paying a little extra for Apple hardware.
