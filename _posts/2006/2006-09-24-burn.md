As often as I use [Toast](http://www.roxio.com/enu/products/toast/titanium/overview.html) and refer to it in postings here, it's easy to overlook some of the freeware options that will usually work just as well.  [Burn](http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/) is one such program which allows you to easily burn data, audio, video, and disc images.  Unlike Toast -- and more like Disk Utility -- Burn uses Apple's disc burning APIs, which are provided for developers to add CD and DVD writing capabilities to their programs with little effort.  It can handle Mac and PC formatted discs, audio and MP3 CDs, all kinds of video discs (DVD included), as well as a number of disc image formats.  While it doesn't have all the bells and whistles Toast has, Burn may provide all the features you need for free.
