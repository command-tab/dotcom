title: Flash Programmer

Wanting to get even further into the inner workings of technology, I recently bought a GALEP-4 Flash and EEPROM programmer which makes it easy to read the contents of various storage chips which are often used to hold device firmware.  Although that sounds complicated, the way most electronics work is quite logical.  For example, somewhere inside your iPod or Xbox is a chip that holds the instructions to make it run.  With this programmer, reading out the contents of said chips is a rather easy task, leaving the challenging part up to the future experimenting and hacking.  Most PCs also use similar chips, so if any readers have experienced a bad BIOS flash, get in touch and chances are I can help you rewrite the chip with the proper data.
