title: Installing DarwinPorts
---
If you're comfortable trying out new software and familiar with the command line interface in Mac OS X, you may want to try out the [DarwinPorts](http://www.darwinports.org/) package management system. Justin Mayer has written a great [tutorial](http://www.servercodex.com/archives/2006/02/06/installing-darwinports-tiger/ "http://www.servercodex.com/archives/2006/02/06/installing-darwinports-tiger/") detailing how to get up and running with DarwinPorts and the latest OS X 10.4.4 update.

In the past I've used [Fink](http://fink.sourceforge.net/), but following this article, I'm going to give DarwinPorts a try. With Mac OS X built on a Unix foundation, a great library of free software has become readily available for the Mac. DarwinPorts helps out by doing any necessary tweaks to ensure that it all works smoothly, as well as providing an uncomplicated setup system.
