title: iPod Breakout Card
---
Just recently, I received my iPod Breakout Card, and I finally finished assembling it tonight.  By using a the same [JAE](http://www.jae-connector.com/en/index.cfm) manufactured connectors as the official iPod ones, each pin from the Dock connector can be individually run to a much larger pad, making it easy to interact with the iPod.  I intend to install a row of pins on each side and allow the entire card to be snapped into a breadboard for easy prototyping.

While I'm not sure what kind of hack I'll be using it for yet, I do intend to post some code written for the BASIC Stamp II, as I don't yet have any PIC experience (I should write about the BlackBerry-like devices a buddy and I made years ago using a pair of BSII chips and wifi transceivers!  A story for another day...)

You, too, can order and assembly your very own iPod breakout card from [Ridax](http://home.swipnet.se/ridax/connector.htm) in Sweden.  It took a few days for my parts to get to the U.S., but they arrived well packed and ready to be used.  This should be the start of some more interesting iPod hacks!
