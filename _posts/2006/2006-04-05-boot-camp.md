title: Boot Camp
---
Apple is now officially prepping a technology to allow Windows XP to run on Intel based Macs.  Currently called "Boot Camp," the software will ship with the next major release of Mac OS X.  For all the details and beta software, visit Apple's [Boot Camp beta](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/) page.  You'll have to provide your own Windows XP SP2 CD, of course, but Apple intends to make a multi-boot Mac a legitimate reality.
