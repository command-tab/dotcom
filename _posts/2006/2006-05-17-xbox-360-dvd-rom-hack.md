title: Xbox 360 DVD-ROM Hack
---
Yesterday, a clever hacker [released](http://www.xbox-scene.com/xbox1data/sep/EEuZyyVFyprcUrLDTt.php) a modified firmware file for the Xbox 360's DVD drive which essentially causes it to lie to the console about the type of media off which games are running.  This comes not long after the release of a similar firmware for the original Xbox, allowing an unmodified (i.e. no modchip) console to run games off a burned DVD.  While both of these hacks are impressive, they currently offer no advances towards running unsigned code, particularly on the Xbox 360.  Despite that, I'll soon picking up a 360 to hack around with.  This is the first crack in the wall I've been waiting for.
