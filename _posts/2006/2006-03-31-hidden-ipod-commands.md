I grew tired of Googling each time I needed the correct button sequence to put iPods into their various modes, so I've put together this little table.

| iPod Generation               | Hard Reset    | Diagnostic Mode          | Disk Mode       |
|-------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 1st Generation "Scroll Wheel" | Menu + Play   | Previous + Center + Next | Previous + Next |
| 2nd Generation "Touch Wheel"  | Menu + Play   | Previous + Center + Next | Previous + Next |
| 3rd Generation "Touch Wheel"  | Menu + Play   | Previous + Center + Next | Previous + Next |
| 4th Generation "Click Wheel"  | Menu + Center | Previous + Center        | Center + Play   |
| 5th Generation "Click Wheel"  | Menu + Center | Previous + Center        | Center + Play   |
