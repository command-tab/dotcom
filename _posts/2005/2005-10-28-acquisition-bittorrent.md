title: Acquisition + BitTorrent
---
In a newly released [beta version](http://www.newsfirex.com/blog/?p=85), the Mac P2P application [Acquisition](http://www.acquisitionx.com/) now supports the BitTorrent protocol. What this means is that you can use the gorgeous Acquisition interface for both Gnutella as well as BitTorrent file sharing. The new version also adds downloaded videos to iTunes along with your other videos. As the author puts it, "Acquisition now provides a seamless path from .torrent file to your iTunes Library." I've been waiting for a really Mac-like BitTorrent application for a long time, and I'm not surprised it came from David Watanabe.
