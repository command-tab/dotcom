title: Mac Mini Projects

If you recently got a Mac Mini and are still looking for something useful to do with it, aside from using it as a normal desktop computer, here are [50 Mac Mini projects](http://mundy.org/blog/index.php?p=40) to keep you busy. Useful purposes include web and mail servers, firewalls, backup servers, and media players. The Mini fits into the server category very well, considering it's lack of a built-in display, as well as it's FireWire connectivity. If you're looking for a technical summer project involving everyone's favorite "headless iMac," that's the place to start.
