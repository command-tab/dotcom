title: iPod Evolution

MP3.com has an interesting [article](http://www.mp3.com/story/feature_ipod_wheel.html) on the evolution of the iPod scroll wheel, and how it developed from a physical control to the popular touch-sensitive interface it is today. Personally, I prefer the current click wheel, as it provides a nice balance between the trackpad-like behavior, but still maintains the clickable button feel.
