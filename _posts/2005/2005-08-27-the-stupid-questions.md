title: The Stupid Questions
---
>When you ask a colleague for help, particularly in programming, you want him to know less about your project... so he will ask the stupid questions you sub-consciously avoided asking yourself because you thought you knew the answer, when in fact you didn't.

I've thought about this many times while programming, and I've never seen it [said](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html) so well. Sometimes, when some code of mine isn't working, I'll take a break and do something else and work on it later. Quite often, taking a new look at the code forces you to (inadvetently) ask yourself those stupid questions. I almost always find that I've made an assumption somewhere along the lines, and my thoughts were not consistent with the actual workings.
