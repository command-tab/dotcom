While I'm on the topic of converting audio, I though I'd mention [EasyWMA](http://www.carrafix.com/EasyWMA/). It's an often overlooked application for the Mac which converts WMA audio files to MP3 and WAV format, making them much more Mac-friendly. It's as simple as a drag-and-drop operation to convert your audio files from one to the other.

Do note, though, that converting from one "lossy" format to another means that there may be some degradation of audio quality.  It's unlikely to be noticeable if you're converting from, say, 320 Kbps WMA to 128 or 160 Kbps MP3, but it's still there.  Personally, I've never noticed a change at all, but I'm far from an audiophile.

If quality isn't of the absolute utmost importance (which it's unlikely to be if you're even dealing with WMA and MP3 files in the first place), EasyWMA provides an idiot-proof way to juggle the audio formats so you can play WMA files in iTunes.
