title: iPod Dock Connectors
---
I purchased a few iPod Dock connectors from a fellow on the [iPodLinux forums](http://www.ipodlinux.org/forums) so I can get started on my next iPod project. I'm thinking about designing a PCB to solder the connectors to, making it easier to plug into a breadboard. Any recommendations for an extremely low-run PCB manufacturer?
