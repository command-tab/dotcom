title: WordPress 2.0

WordPress 2.0 is almost here and sports a [long list](http://asymptomatic.net/2005/11/29/2135/whats-new-in-wordpress-20/) of new features, including the Akismet antispam plugin I rave about, as well as a backup plugin to keep your site safe. I can't wait to upgrade, and may do a bit of a redesign shortly after (my CSS is ridiculous in size, and is still broken here and there). Having messed with a number of blogging systems on my own machine, I can yet again highly recommend WordPress for its two-minute installation, nearly infinite customizability, and overall ease of use.
