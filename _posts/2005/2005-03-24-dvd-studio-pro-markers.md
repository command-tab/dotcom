title: DVD Studio Pro Markers
---
Recently, I needed an easy way to get chapter markers into [DVD Studio Pro](http://www.apple.com/dvdstudiopro/) without re-encoding my video with embedded markers, and I ran across an interesting tidbit of information. DVD Studio Pro has an "Import Marker List" command, but I wasn't sure what kind of file it was expecting...another multimedia file with embedded markers? A CSV file? A proprietary format marker list? After much searching, I found [this site](http://www.promax.com/Tips/Tip/?Num=1) which shows you exactly how to import a plain old tab-delimited file into your DVD Studio Pro track. Slick.

**Update:** Saved [PDF version](/static/dvd_sp_markers.pdf) just in case the site goes away.
