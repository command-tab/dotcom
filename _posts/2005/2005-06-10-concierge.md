[Concierge](http://www.bti.net/concierge/) is a handy little bookmarks drawer which attaches to Safari windows as if it were a built-in function. It allows you to view your browser history sorted by domain, edit your Safari bookmarks without using an entire window or tab, as well as temporarily store links. Personally, I have a habit of throwing links into my Dock and letting them accumulate. After a week goes by, I may end up with a dozen identical-looking URLs in my Dock, each pointing to a place I meant to visit but didn't have time. Concierge seems to be a great solution for me, and may help you out too. More information is available at [Concierge](http://www.bti.net/concierge/)'s homepage, as well as [MacUpdate](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/16545).
