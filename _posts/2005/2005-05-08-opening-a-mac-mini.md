title: Opening a Mac Mini
---
I still find a surprising amount of people who are convinced that they won't be able to open a Mac Mini and upgrade it. It's incredibly easy to do. Other World Computing has a great (200MB!) video tutorial on opening and upgrading the Mac Mini, and it can be found [here](http://eshop.macsales.com/tech_center/index.cfm?page=Video/directory.html), along with videos for a bunch of other Mac models.
