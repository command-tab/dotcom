title: Google Analytics and Mint
---
Shortly after [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) was released, I gave it a shot. Several days after properly setting it up, I still wasn't getting results. Today, I read that it [doesn't work in Safari](http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/18/google-analytics-hates-safari/). So much for depending on Google for stats.

As a full time Safari user, I gave up on that front and purchased [Mint](http://www.haveamint.com/), an easy to use (and wonderful to look at) web stats generator by Shaun Inman. While it doesn't have graphical pie graphs like Google Analytics, it sure makes checking out my stats a breeze. Some webmasters go all-out and get very detailed with stats, but me, I just what to have a general idea of what's going on and what's hot. For the cost of the average shareware app, Mint reports all this and more with a clean, refreshing style. I couldn't be happer with it. To top it all off, there's a simple Tiger widget included in the purchase which displays total visitors.
