Griffin Technology has introduced [SmartDeck](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/smartdeck/index.php), an iPod-to-cassette adapter which senses the tape deck's movements and sends the appropriate remote control signals to your iPod. While it currently only works with iPods that sport a serial remote control, the device can tell the speed and direction of the small wheels inside your cassette player which are normally used to move the magnetic tape from one tiny reel to the other. Cassette adapters have no tape, so the wheels usually spin free while your play music through your car stereo via your iPod. With the SmartDeck, you can keep your iPod stashed in the glovebox and simply use the tape deck's buttons to remotely control the iPod. What an awesome idea.
