title: Xbox 360 Security
---
Ars has a short but sweet [article](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050910-5296.html) on how the upcoming Xbox 360 is designed to be secure. I'm sure they thought that about the original Xbox, too, which they describe as being "hacked silly." With as much processing power and I/O options as the 360 offers, I'm sure it will be hacked in short order despite any security they build in. Even if the hardware isn't hackable, there will always be buffer overflows to exploit, like they did with the Agent Under Fire hack. Also, the [SmartXX](http://www.smartxx.com) modchip team already has several Xbox 360 developer kits and have disassembled them. With any luck, we'll have a 360 modchip at launch! Xbox Media Center 360 here we come.
