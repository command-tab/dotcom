title: Google Maps Address Book Plugin
---
That was quick! Following the release of the Google Maps API, Brian Toth has created an Address Book plugin which adds a "Google Map" menu option when you click on someone's address field. Installation is very straightforward, making for a quick Address Book addition which will come in handy. [Check it out](http://www.briantoth.com/addressbook/).
