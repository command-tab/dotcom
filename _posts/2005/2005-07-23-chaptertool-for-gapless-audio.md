title: ChapterTool for Gapless Audio
---
Here's a unique use for ChapterTool: combine audio tracks from a "gapless" audio CD into one file, but maintain chapters as different songs. Combining songs in this way lets you play the album straight through without gaps, but still allows the choice of song by skipping though chapters. The iPod image near the bottom makes it quite clear as to how it works. Check out the tutorial on [wanderingFocus](http://gapless.itunes.wanderingfocus.com/).
