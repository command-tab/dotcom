title: Wooden iPod Hack
---
A user on the [bit-tech](http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=93499) forums has created a polished wooden iPod front panel, including covers for the scrolls wheel and select button. Done with a Dremel rotary tool, the faceplate is actually wooden replica of the white plastic half of the iPod case. A new Lexan screen cover was cut to fit, and when done and polished, this mod looks absolutely stunning. Check out all the photos at the [Flickr gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zapwizard/sets/476089/). [[via](http://www.tuaw.com/2005/07/04/wooden-ipod-case-mod/)]
