My good friend and fellow [Mac User Group](http://www.acamug.org) member [Dave Warker](http://www.warker.com) developed a new iTunes controller called [hotTunes](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/18213). It's just a small application which has almost no interface, but controls iTunes via key commands. While others have pointed out that there are other options out there, I happen to prefer this one above the others. For instance, I've used [SizzlingKeys](http://www.yellowmug.com/sk4it/) for a long time, but it takes a little while to respond if the computer is busy processing something else. I've also tried [Synergy](http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/), but I don't really need yet another menu bar item. However, hotTunes just sits in your Dock and waits for a key command to pause, play, rate, or show information. I helped design the hotTunes icon, too, so part of me likes seeing my own work in my Dock. Regardless, [hotTunes](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/18213) is a great little key command based iTunes controller, and I highly recommend it.
