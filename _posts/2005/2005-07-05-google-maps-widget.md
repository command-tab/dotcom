title: Google Maps Widget

This is the last Google Maps related post for a while, I swear! I just couldn't resist bringing this widget to others' attention, as I find it incredibly useful. The [Google Maps Widget](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/transportation/googlemapswidget.html) provides "in-widget" maps of whatever location you specify, as opposed to opening a browser window with your query. It looks and works much like the Dictionary widget provided by Apple. Check out the details at Apple's [widget page](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/transportation/googlemapswidget.html).
