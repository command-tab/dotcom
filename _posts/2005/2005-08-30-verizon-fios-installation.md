title: Verizon FIOS Installation
---
For those interested in the super-super-high-speed FIOS internet connection Verizon is offering in certain cities ([check yours](http://www22.verizon.com/FiosForHome/channels/Fios/HighSpeedInternetForHome.asp)), [here's](http://www.bricklin.com/fiosinstall.htm) a wonderfully detailed log of one installation, complete with start to finish photos. Once installed, the author was able to download at about 13 MB/sec, and upload at almost 2 MB/sec! That's just unheard of for a home connection... I want it.
