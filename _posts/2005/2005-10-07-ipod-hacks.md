title: iPod Hacks
---
I've got a few more iPod hacks planned if I can come up with the hardware.  So, I'm on the hunt for more dead or "injured" iPods, preferably 3rd or 4th Gen...although 2nd might do.  If anyone has an iPod with a dead hard drive they're willing to part with, send me an email using the link on the right :-)  I'll also happily do iPod battery installations, if anyone's in need of a quick repair.
