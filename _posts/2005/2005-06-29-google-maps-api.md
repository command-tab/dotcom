title: Google Maps API
---
A note to web application developers -- Google has finally opened their maps service via an [Maps API](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/), allowing you to programmatically make use of their maps, as well as plot routes and markers. Previously, the only way to do such a thing was by disassembling the JavaScript which Google uses and creating your own unsupported solution. Now you can create a web application which reliably uses Google Maps without worrying about infrastructure changes affecting your code. You will need a (free) API key to make use of the service, which can be obtained [here](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html). I'm excited to see what new web-based tools can be built using the new Google Maps API! Any suggestions for a small project which makes use of it?
