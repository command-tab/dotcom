I'll second [Jon's recommendation](http://www.jonsthoughtsoneverything.com/2005/07/01/acidsearch/) of [AcidSearch](http://www.pozytron.com/?acidsearch). I, too, was a SafariKeywords addict, but disappointed with the lack of a Tiger update. AcidSearch is a much better replacement, and I couldn't be happier with it.
