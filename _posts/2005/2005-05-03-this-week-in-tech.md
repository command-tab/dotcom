title: This Week In Tech
---
The gang from [The Screen Savers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screen_Savers) ([Leo Laporte](http://leoville.com/blog/), [Patrick Norton](http://www.patricknorton.typepad.com/), [Kevin Rose](http://www.kevinrose.com/), and Robert Heron) have started a Podcast called "This Week In Tech." I'm glad to finally have a consistent stream of tech related content, be it audio or video. The newest "This Week In Tech" Podcast is an hour long, and I couldn't be happier about it. Audio is a nice medium for this because you can listen to it on the way to or during work, whereas video takes more attention and bandwidth. However, I'm also looking forward to Kevin Rose's new video project, [Systm](http://systm.org/) (no 'e'). Keep up the awesome work, guys! Glad to have you back.

[Here](http://leoville.tv/twit-aac/) is a link to Leo's This Week In Tech web page with torrents for bookmarkable AAC files, which will play on iPods, iTunes, and QuickTime Player. Bookmarkable AAC files are my choice for audio content of this sort because you can pause it, and the playhead position is saved so you can come back to it later and pick up right where you left off. Better living through audio formats. Enjoy!
