[Jaron Brass](http://www.kissmybrass.net) showed me a great little tool for checking the life of your PowerBook (or iBook) battery, [coconutBattery](http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/). It works by doing the appropriate `ioreg` command and extracting the relevant battery information. It can report the number of charge cycles, the current and maximum charges, and the age of your Mac. I wasn't even aware all that information was even available to software running on every Mac. In any event, it's time for me to buy a new PowerBook battery, and [coconutBattery](http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) helped me easily make the decision by showing exactly where my battery life stands.
