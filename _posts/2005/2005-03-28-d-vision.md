When it comes to encoding video on the Mac, you have lots of options.  You can spend [as much](http://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/) or as little as you want.  Since we don't all have hundreds of dollars to spend on video applications, there is a nice selection of cheap video tools out there.  One of the ones I've recently started using is [D-Vision](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/8825).  Not only can D-Vision encode ripped DVDs to various multimedia formats, it also includes a handful of useful tools for segmenting/joining/repairing AVI files, converting audio, joining VOB files (commonly found on DVDs), and extracting DVD subtitles.  I've found D-Vision to be an easy one-step application for backing up my DVDs onto my Xbox, making for quick access while maintaining high quality audio and video.
