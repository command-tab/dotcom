title: Widget Development FAQ
---
For those interested in creating Dashboard widgets, a great development FAQ has been posted over at dashboardwidgets.com. [Check it out](http://www.dashboardwidgets.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=831). Apple also has documentation, which can be found [here](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashboard_Tutorial/index.html).

I'm working on two widgets of my own, and you can be sure I'll post them here soon!
