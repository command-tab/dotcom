[Panic, Inc.](http://panic.com/) just updated their system information utility, [Stattoo](http://panic.com/stattoo/), to version 1.2. I've been waiting for Tiger support for this since I upgraded my system, and I'll definitely be using this little gem now that it plays nice again. If you haven't used it before, Stattoo draws small "tattoos" on your desktop, showing you quick tidbits of information such as disk space, the date, iCal events, battery life, and more. While the principle is the same as Dashboard's, Stattoo stays active on your desktop all the time and blends right in with your work, keeping you informed without getting in your way.
