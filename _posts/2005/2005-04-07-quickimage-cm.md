[QuickImage CM](http://www.pixture.com/macosx.php) is an extremely handy contextual menu plugin which I use mainly for converting images from one format to another without opening Photoshop or GraphicConverter. It also has the ability of creating thumbnail icons, copying the image contents to the clipboard, scaling, and more. It's also freeware, so if you work with graphics at all, you'll want to check out this little gem.
