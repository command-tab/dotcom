Here's a great project I happened to run across while sorting through bookmarks. Henry Arnold's [Cricket](http://home.earthlink.net/~henryarnold/) is a six-legged walking robot, controlled by a [BASIC Stamp II](http://www.parallaxinc.com) microcontroller. Full wiring diagrams, frame layouts, and source code are all available for you to make your own 'bot.

While the site doesn't look like it's changed in the last five or so years, the project is none the less fun to build and learn from. I put one together one many years ago as my first robot built from scratch, not using pre-made kits or packages of any sort. All the materials had to be bought from various suppliers, cut, assembled, etc. It took a number of weeks to get it going, but it was a great learning experience. During the process, I emailed back and forth with the designer himself, and he was most helpful. The Cricket robot was my first introduction to programming microcontrollers, and that has since spurred on many other hardware projects.

Definitely [give it a look](http://home.earthlink.net/~henryarnold/) if you want to get into electronics or embedded hardware.
