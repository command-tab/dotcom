title: Fast Robot Prototyping
---
IBM has an cool article detailing some techniques you can use to quickly build robots with common materials. [Wireless robotics: Fast robot prototyping](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/library/wi-robot3/?ca=dgr-lnxwRobotP3) shows you how to use foam core, plexiglass, Erector set parts, and cardboard to put together a robot platform to build upon without breaking the bank on a design that's likely to change. Neat stuff -- I wasn't even aware IBM published articles like this.
