Roxio just announced [Toast Titianium 7](http://www.roxio.com/go/toast7/index.jhtml), a major upgrade to their awesome CD and DVD burning application.

I've been using Toast since verison 5, and I still swear by it for nearly all my CD and DVD needs, except for those where Disk Utility is absolutely necessary. Toast 7 takes everything a step further, and features DivX 6 encoding for high definition content, iDVD-like menu creation, H.264 and PSP encoding, audio recording, and the ability to span an archive across multiple discs (as well as restore it either in full or per file).

MacWorld has a [detailed article](http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/08/19/toast7/index.php?lsrc=mwrss) covering all the new features. I can't wait to get the new version!
