[Dave Warker](http://www.warker.com/) has released [hotTunes 2.0](http://www.warker.com/hottunes.html), an update to his fantastic iTunes hot-key controller. New features include hotkeys to control all sorts of new iTunes abilities, hotPlay playlists, track change detection, AppleScript execution on certain events, play mode cycling, and controls to disable nearly all attention-grabbing windows. It's definitely worth a look, and is a refreshing change from other iTunes controllers out there. You can check it out at [his website](http://www.warker.com/hottunes.html) or at [MacUpdate](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/18213).
