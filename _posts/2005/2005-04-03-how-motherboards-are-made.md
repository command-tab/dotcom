title: How Motherboards Are Made
---
[PCStats.com](http://www.pcstats.com/index1.html) has an interesting tour of [GigaByte's](http://www.gigabyte.com.tw) motherboard factory. The amount of custom machinery is amazing. Many of the machines involved are specific to one motherboard model and need to be changed for each design. Once all the components are placed by machines and by hand, the motherboards pass through a wave solder machine which solders all the connection points at once. It's very cool - worth a look.
