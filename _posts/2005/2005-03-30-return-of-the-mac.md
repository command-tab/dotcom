title: Return of the Mac
---
Just days after I posted my little blurb about [Hackers and Painters](/2005/03/26/hackers-and-painters/), Paul Graham published a great article on the [return of the Mac](http://www.paulgraham.com/mac.html).

>"If you want to attract hackers to write software that will sell your hardware, you have to make it something that they themselves use. It's not enough to make it 'open.' It has to be open and good."

This is where the Mac is headed.
