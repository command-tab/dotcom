[PlaintextPaste](http://www.pozytron.com/plaintextpaste) is a small InputManager plugin that adds "Paste Plain Text" to the Edit menu of all OS X native applications. It's useful for several reasons. When you copy text in Mac OS X, the formatting options such as font, size, and color come along with the text. I find that, most of the time, I don't need or want anything but the text, especially when pasting into iChat. With PlaintextPaste installed, you can hit Command-C to copy text like normal, then hit Command-Shift-V to paste only the text, or Command-V to paste it with formatting. The second reason I like PlaintextPaste is that it has the option to swap the current selection with the clipboard contents - handy for programming. On top all of that, it's free.
