title: 'Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger: April 29th'
---
Apple has updated their homepage with a sleek black look to promote the release of Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger."  The site says that Tiger will officially ship on April 29th.  I'm eagerly awaiting all the new goodies from Apple, along with many others, I'm sure.

The number on feature I'm looking forward to is Spotlight.  I tend to save all sorts of things (text clippings, random little images from websites that I thought were neat, etc.), and categorizing it would be more of a hassle than just letting Spotlight sift through it all.  It seems like Spotlight will be picked up by many developers, too.  We should see a huge flurry of activity in the 30 days following Tiger's release as developers add in metadata to their files and applications.  In testing, Spotlight indexes remarkably fast and should do so in the final GM release as well.

Hopefully developers are already working on updating their applications to work well with 10.4.  Apple is right in saying that this is the most significant update to Mac OS X yet.  I can't wait!

**Update:** [Here](http://www.apple.com/macosx/newfeatures/newfeatures.html) is a list of all the new features in Tiger!
