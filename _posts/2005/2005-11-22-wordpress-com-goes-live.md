Mentioned briefly in my [post](http://www.command-tab.com/index.php/akismet-kills-comment-spam/) about the comment spam filter Akismet, [WordPress.com](http://www.wordpress.com/) is [out of beta](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/11/21/wordpresscom-out-of-beta/) and open to anyone who wants to sign up. Not to be confused with the downloadable version at [wordpress.org](http://www.wordpress.org), WordPress.com is a free Blogger style site where you can create an account and instantly run a blog powered by (you guessed it) the WordPress publishing system.
