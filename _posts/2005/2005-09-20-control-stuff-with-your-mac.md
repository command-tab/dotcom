title: Control Stuff With Your Mac
---
[Here's](http://www.hexten.net/2005/09/19/control-stuff-with-your-mac) a great little article on how to control devices using your Mac and a USB interface board. For similar projects, I may also reccommend Delcom Engineering [USB I/O chips](http://www.delcom-eng.com/products_USBIO.asp#USBIO), which are dirt cheap and not too hard to communicate with using the included OS X drivers. Good for a [Mac Mini robot](http://www.hackaday.com/entry/1234000937058230/) project, perhaps?
