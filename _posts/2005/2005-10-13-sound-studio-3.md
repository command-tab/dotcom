title: Sound Studio 3
---
[Freeverse Software](http://www.freeverse.com/) and [Felt Tip Software](http://www.felttip.com/) have announced [Sound Studio 3](http://www.freeverse.com/soundstudio/), a significant upgrade to one of my favorite Mac audio programs. Sure, you can use GarageBand to edit audio, but Sound Studio is far more lightweight. While it doesn't support multi-track audio, sometimes you simply don't need all that to do audio editing. For example, creating a 30-second clip of an MP3 for a podcast while fading the beginning and end, is a simple task with Sound Studio. It can juggle AIFF, AAC, MP3, WAV, and SD2 formats as necessary, and is also AppleScript-ready through Automator. For doing quick audio edits, Sound Studio is my main application, and I'm eagerly awaiting the new upgrade, due out later this month.
