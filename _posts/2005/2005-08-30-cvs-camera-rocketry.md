title: CVS Camera Rocketry
---
This is really cool, and is the kind of thing I wish I had access to years ago... CVS is selling digital cameras and camcorders for startlingly cheap prices, with the only drawback being that most people have to take them back to the store to have the contents "developed." And I say "most people," but there are always clever people out there, possibly like yourself, who are willing take take the devices apart and figure out their inner workings. One such project involves the CVS camcorder and a model rocket. The guts of the camera were fitted into the nose cone of a rocket, and it was launched while video was being recorded. You check out the awesome results [here](http://www.csh.rit.edu/~soup/cvscam/). For more information on getting the videos out of the camera itself, see John Maushammer's [fine work](http://www.maushammer.com/systems/cvscamcorder/).
