title: Hi-Res Xbox 360 Videos
---
Microsoft has posted over a dozen [high resolution videos](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=abde1e02-b529-469e-ae6a-7417fcde9e12&displaylang=en#filelist) of Xbox 360 games on their site, many of which look very impressive, despite the fact that none of the hardware or software is finalized yet. Unfortunately, the videos are in Windows Media 9 format, so you'll need Windows Media Player or the Flip4Mac WMV Plugin to play them. If there's demand for it, I'll convert them to a Mac-friendly format, however I don't have the bandwidth required to host H.264 versions of them. If anyone has enough of bandwidth to serve up several 100MB+ videos, please contact me. As far as the gaming goes on the Xbox 360, it should be interesting to see how things work out as developers learn how to take advantage of the power available in the new console.
