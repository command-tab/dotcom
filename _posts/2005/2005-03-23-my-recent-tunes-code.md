title: My Recent Tunes Code
---
[Here is the code](/assets/recent_tunes.zip) that I use to power my Recent Tunes list seen at right. It's a little messy, but at least commented so you have some clue what each part is doing. The `cover_update.php` script is what does most of the work. You shouldn't have to change anything in the amazon folder -- that's all there to talk to the Amazon.com API, which [you will need access to](http://www.amazon.com:80/gp/redirect.html/ref=sc_fe_l_0_3435361_1/103-2819161-5079023?location=http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/registration/registration-form.html&token=64D8DEF11B4D531BB7C41DB0617BCDE1819B9C86 "Register to use the Amazon.com API"). I also recommend [Recent Tunes](http://freshsqueeze.com/products/freeware/) for updating your tracks from iTunes. Note that I use the current tune, not the list of recent tunes, as it makes managing the MySQL database easier and lessens the load put on Amazon's API (which I imagine has a ~1000 query per day limit). If you have questions about using it, post a comment so that others can benefit from the conversation as well.
