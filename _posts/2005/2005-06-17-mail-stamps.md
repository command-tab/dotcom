I've been meaning to add this little app for a long while. [Mail Stamps](http://andrewescobar.com/mailstamps) removes the new aqua buttons from Mail in Tiger. While I know many people who like with the new look and enjoy the segmented toolbar items, I -- and apparently others -- happen to prefer the Panther look. Mail Stamps runs and changes the .tiff files inside Mail back to the Panther look. It has an uninstaller, but as always, make a backup of Mail.app before running Mail Stamps. Mail now sports the good old buttons I've come to know and love in past OS releases.
