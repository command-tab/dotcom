title: iMac LC III on G4TV
---
While watching the recent items in my iTunes podcast subscriptions, I saw Phil Torrone (of _[MAKE Magazine](http://www.makezine.com/)_) mention some hacks on G4/TechTV's _Attack of the Show_. While describing the philosophy behind the magazine, one of the items he featured was my [iMac LC III](/2005/06/20/imac-lc-iii/) hack, where I fit the parts of a gumdrop shaped iMac into an LC III case and made it work. This totally made my day.
