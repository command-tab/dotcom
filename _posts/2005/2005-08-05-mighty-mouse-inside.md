title: Mighty Mouse Inside
---
The crazy people at [ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/) bought a brand new [Mighty Mouse](http://www.command-tab.com/index.php/mighty-mouse/) from Apple and immediately [dissected and documented](http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/hardware/dissect.ars) it. Taking apart Apple products is [always fun](http://www.command-tab.com/index.php/isight-inside/), and there seems to be an unspoken race to be the first to crack open new hardware shortly after it's arrival. I usually use new technology for a while before hacking it, waiting at least until the novelty wears off, but details and photos of new products are always appreciated -- especially when the disassembly is irreversible.
