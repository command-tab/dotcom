title: Two-Wheeled Balancing Robot
---
Via [digg](http://digg.com/robots/nBot,_a_two_wheeled_balancing_robot), here are videos and tons of information on a skillfully engineered two-wheeled robot that can balance itself as well as drive around. An electronic gyroscope and accelerometers help orient the 'bot and keep it upright while moving, and a separate sensor provides tilt data while it is at rest. Built by [David Anderson](http://www.geology.smu.edu/~dpa-www/dpa.html), the balancing [nBot](http://www.geology.smu.edu/~dpa-www/robo/nbot/) is an impressive piece of work.
