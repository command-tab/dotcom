title: BitTorrent Update
---
After quite a long period with little or no changes, BitTorrent finally received an update, including a new Mac release by Andrew Loewenstern.  Version 4.0.1 features a brushed metal interface (which some love and some hate), a global upload rate setting, and the ability to automatically stop torrents after they've finished given certain limits.  Overall, I like the new version and the interface.  It's a refreshing change from the plain old BitTorrent window.  The new version is available for several operating systems at [BitTorrent.com](http://www.bittorrent.com).
