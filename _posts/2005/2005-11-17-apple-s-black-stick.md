title: Apple's "Black Stick"
---

In all the official Apple Service Source guides, where detailed take-apart information for every Apple product is listed, they make references to a tool called only the "black stick." It's used for prying open plastic cases without chewing up the edge like a metal screwdriver would. However, they don't mention what this tool really is or where to obtain one. [RadTech](http://www.radtech.us/), makers of my favorite iPod cases and [polishing solutions](/2005/07/28/ipod-screen-scratch-removal/), sells what seems to be the tool Apple uses. However, they sell this nylon pry tool for a ridiculous $7. For a strong plastic stick. Being [in need](/2005/03/13/ipod-super/) and not knowing where else to get it, I ordered one not too long ago. After receiving it and noticing some information stamped on it, I did some searching and found out they're manufacured by [Menda](http://www.mendapump.com/), makers of various lab tools. I also managed to find an online distributor with a website that works. So, if you're in need of an iPod opener that won't mark up the case, and which doubles as a handy soldering tool, get your "black stick" from [ESD Systems](http://www.esdsystems.com/ViewProduct.aspx?pid=35622&pcid=278) for $1.59.

**Update:** Buy [this stick](http://www.stanleysupplyservices.com/product-group.aspx?id=10980) from Stanley Supply. It's sturdier than the pointy stick and makes opening iPods and Mac hardware a breeze.
