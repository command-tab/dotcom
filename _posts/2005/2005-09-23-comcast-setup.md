title: Comcast Setup
---
Here's a [scary article](http://mikey-san.net/damage/archives/2005/09/race_condition.html) detailing the unsafe security practices of Comcast's cable modem setup software. Definitely worth a read if you have or plan to set up cable internet through Comcast. I'm glad I've always insisted on just calling them up after receiving the cable modem and simply reading off the serial number and MAC address off the bottom of the modem.

Setting up an internet connection really shouldn't require anything complicated, much less software that poses a significant security threat to your computer.  If Macs do eventually end up with viruses and trojans and all that mess, it will be because of serious oversights like this on the part of other companies, not bugs within OS itself.  That said, I've been quite happy with the speed of Comcast's service, that's for sure.
