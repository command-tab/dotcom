title: Ultimate Xbox HD Pack

While scouring Google for an image, I ran across this fantastic schematic of a way to get nearly every possible audio/video output out of the Xbox.  It represents the bottom of the Xbox motherboard, where you would solder wires to the Xbox AVIP connector (the inside back of the Xbox A/V port).  Using switches, you can control the video modes and get just about any format video you could possibly need from the Xbox.
