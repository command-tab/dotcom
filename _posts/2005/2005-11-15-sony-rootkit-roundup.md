title: Sony Rootkit Roundup
---
BoingBoing has a great [timeline](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/14/sony_anticustomer_te.html) of the Sony "rootkit" fiasco that's recently made news around the world. I'll leave the details up to them. For a great audio summary, download the related [Security Now!](http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm) podcast. The EFF has also posted an open [letter](http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/Sony-BMG/?f=open-letter-2005-11-14.html), asking Sony to make good. Here's hoping that Sony receives legal action as a result of their spyware-like tactics. Lastly, Wired magazine is calling for consumers to [boycott](http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,69559,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2) Sony copy-protected CDs until they come clean and recall all the infected discs.
