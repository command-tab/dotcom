title: HandBrake 0.7.0
---
A new version of [Handbrake](http://handbrake.m0k.org/download.php) is out, which supports the iPod's video specifications. It also fixes some bugs such as the one I run into -- not recognizing certain titles. It also adds basic queue support and multi-thread H.264 encoding. I'm glad to see that this great application is still being developed, as it's one of my favorite video encoders.
