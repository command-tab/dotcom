title: Tiger Goes Gold
---
As reported on [AppleInsider](http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=976), Mac OS X 10.4 build 8A428 was declared Gold Master, which means that code is frozen and the disc is sent off to be duplicated.  We should see 10.4 on shelves very shortly.

AppleInsider says "Mac OS X Tiger is expected to hit retail stores in the second half of April. In the past, Apple has held special launch events at its retail stores and other retailers have also joined with special events and festivities of their own."  The second half of April sounds rather far away, although that might just be my excitement preying on me.  Either way, this Mac OS X launch is going to be the biggest one yet.  Rock on, Apple.  Here's looking forward to another successful major OS release.
