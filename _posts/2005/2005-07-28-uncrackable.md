title: Uncrackable
---
While I'd like to keep this a Mac-oriented site, I can't help but chuckle at how fast technology gets cracked. Case in point: Several days ago, Microsoft launched their Windows Genuine Advantage program which ensures that only real, licensed copies of Windows can receive updates. Pirated copies of Windows will only be able to get patches up to the launch of the WGA program, but will be left behind from future updates. [Not anymore](http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=24134).

It's always a bad idea to tout your product as uncrackable. Doing so is nothing more than a big, blinking, neon sign attracting talented individuals to try their best to break it. I can't think of a piece of technology yet that hasn't been cracked in some way. Xbox, PSP, TiVo, and software activation of all sorts have been cracked...
