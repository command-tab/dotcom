title: 'Firefox: G4 and G5 Optimized'
---
Firefox has finally reached version 1.5 for all available systems and is a highly recommended upgrade for all owners of this great browser. There are also [G4 and G5 optimized versions](http://www.beatnikpad.com/archives/2005/12/01/firefox15) for those with the appropriate processors. Lastly, John Nunemaker has some [tips](http://addictedtonew.com/archives/105/firefox-on-a-mac-now-enjoyable/) to make Firefox look more like a Mac application and hide its multi-platform feel (which is about the only drawback making me use Safari nearly full time).
