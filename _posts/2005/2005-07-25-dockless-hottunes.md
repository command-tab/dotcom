title: Dockless hotTunes
---
I've found a way to make my favorite iTunes controller, [hotTunes](/2005/05/25/hottunes/), disappear from the Dock while running. While I'm sure it's unsupported, it seems to work quite well for me. Using [Dockless](http://homepage.mac.com/fahrenba/dockless/dockless.html), you can make any Mac OS X application invisible in the Dock, and it works on hotTunes just as well as any other app.
