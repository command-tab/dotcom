It's been a while since I've written about an application here, so I'll start things up again with [Pacifist](http://www.charlessoft.com/). In a nutshell, Pacifist lets you explore and extract the contents of .pkg files, which are installed with Installer.app in the Utilities folder. It has proved valuable a number of times while investigating where a package has installed its files. Sometimes you may only want a specific file or component out of a .pkg, and Pacifict can pull this off with ease, as well.
