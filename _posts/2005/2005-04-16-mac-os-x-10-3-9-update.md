title: Mac OS X 10.3.9 Update
---
Mac OS X 10.3.9 has been released, and will be the final update before Tiger is officially available. It appears that Apple fixed the font issue [documented at daringfireball.net](http://daringfireball.net/2005/03/font_caches_gone_wild) about three weeks ago. The software update [KnowledgeBase article (delta updater)](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300966) states:

>Addresses an issue in which the startup time in Mac OS X 10.3.6 through 10.3.8 may be extended if a large number of PostScript fonts are installed.

I've successfully installed the update on two systems and haven't had any problems so far.
