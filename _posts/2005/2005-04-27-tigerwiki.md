[Jon Maddox](http://www.jonsthoughtsoneverything.com/) and I started a wiki to help document all the cool new features of Mac OS X 10.4. It already has some preliminary content, but there's plenty more new items in Tiger other than the big-name features, and it's all welcome. If you find a useful change made in Tiger or would like to read up on things that have been updated, head on over to [TigerWiki](http://www.tigerwiki.com/) and help out by adding new content. Anyone can register to make changes or add new items.
