title: QuickTime AC3 Codec
---
For those who have problems hearing audio in some AVI videos, I recommend trying out this [AC3 codec](http://www.insaneness.com/ac3.html) for QuickTime and DivX 5.2.1. DivX and XviD videos are extremely common, and the audio codecs they use are generally either MP3 or AC3. With DivX 5.2.1 and this AC3 codec, you should be able to play most AVI videos on the net.
