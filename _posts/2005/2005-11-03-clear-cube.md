title: Clear Cube

Flickr member [macphile](http://www.flickr.com/photos/macphile/) removed the metal RF shielding from the inside of his G4 Cube and reassembled it, leaving a crystal clear case showing the inner workings. Check out all the photos at Flickr under the [Clear Cube](http://www.flickr.com/photos/macphile/sets/374347/) photoset.

Despite the Cube's shortcomings, I still think it's a killer little machine. It doesn't surprise me that many companies are producing upgrades for it to this day. It's also great to see a dedicated circle of people making cool things out of almost collector's item Apple hardware like the Cube, the [Newton](http://www.newted.com), and others.
