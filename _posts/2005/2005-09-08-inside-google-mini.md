title: Inside Google Mini
---
[AnandTech](http://www.anandtech.com/IT/showdoc.aspx?i=2523&p=1) has a great little article on the inner workings of Google's search appliance, [Google Mini](http://www.google.com/enterprise/mini/) (a rackmount server which indexes your intranet). I knew for some time that the device existed, and I'd always been interested to know what's inside and how you configure it. It's worth a look if you're curious. For all the Google related posts I do, you'd think by know I would have a dedicated category for them...
