title: ADB Conversion
---
[Here](http://www.livejournal.com/users/theducks/407281.html) is a hack just like my ADB to USB Mouse Conversion, only using the electronics from a newer Apple mouse. The creator, Alex Dawson, did a great job on the overhaul, especially with the positioning of the board and the placement of the optical sensor. It was recently posted on [hackaday](http://www.hackaday.com/entry/1234000680069834/), which is where I learned of the hack.

On a related note, I just received my first issue of MAKE magazine, and I couldn't be more thrilled with it. If you find the above hack even moderately interesting, you'll want to [get a subscription](http://www.makezine.com).
