[Jon](http://www.jonsthoughtsoneverything.com/2005/11/19/print-my-fonts/trackback/) points out a handy program, [FontParade](http://www.brightpebbles.org/fontparade), for previewing your fonts on paper. Sure, you can scroll through a list on screen, but referencing a tangible list is far easier. I've never found another program that accomplishes quite what this program does. If you have a ton of fonts to browse through in order to achieve just the right look, give [FontParade](http://www.brightpebbles.org/fontparade) a whirl.
