title: Command-Line iSight Tool
---
A new utility, `isightcapture`, is a small command-line program to grab frames from an attached FireWire iSight camera. It also has built-in sizing and formatting options. It's a great tool for developers or users who are mildly familier with the Unix environment, and have a need to grab images from an iSight. It could also be built into a webcam application, a script to upload periodic captures to a webserver, or a similar project. [Check it out!](http://www.intergalactic.de/hacks.html)
