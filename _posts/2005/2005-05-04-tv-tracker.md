[TV Tracker](http://monkeybusinesslabs.com/tv.html) is a Dashboard widget which pulls down Yahoo TV listings and displays them in a clean, glossy, very Mac-like interface. Immediately after opening and playing with TV Tracker, you'll notice how responsive the interface is, as well as little details such as the progress dots on the back and custom scroll bar on the front. Like all widgets should be, it was idiot-proof to set up and use. [TV Tracker](http://monkeybusinesslabs.com/tv.html) is a prime example of a well polished third-party widget.
